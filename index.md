### Abstract

Owning to the unremitting efforts by a few institutes, great progress has recently been made in designing superhuman AIs in No-limit Texas Holdâ€™em (NLTH), the primary testbed for largescale imperfect-information game research. However, it remains very challenging for new researchers to study this problem since there lacks standard benchmarks for comparing with existing methods, which greatly hinders further developments in this research area. 

In this work, we present CasiaHoldem, a benchmark for large-scale imperfectinformation game research using NLTH. CasiaHoldem makes three main contributions to this research direction:

* a standardized evaluation protocol for thoroughly evaluating different NLTH AIs; 
* three publicly available strong baselines for NLTH AI
* an online testing platform with easy-to-use APIs for public NLTH AI evaluation. 

We hope CasiaHoldem will facilitate further studies on the unsolved theoretical and computational issues in this area, and cultivate important research problems like opponent modeling and sub-optimal opponent exploiting.
